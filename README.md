# python-rss-podcast

I've set up automatic downloads for my favorite podcast (Self Hosted -  https://selfhosted.show/) on my Synology and the files were named as the UUID's from Fireside.fm.

I've created this project to rename the shows to a more readable name.

When running the cli.py just point it to the files and supply the rss feed from Fireside.fm. And the files will be renamed.

Docker.py is still a work in progress.
